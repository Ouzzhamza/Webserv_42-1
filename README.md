# Webserv
## Description:

The "Webserv" project is a fundamental HTTP server implementation developed in C++ as part of the 42 Network's curriculum. This server is designed to handle incoming HTTP requests, process them, and generate appropriate responses, thereby functioning as a basic web server.

## Key Features:

HTTP Server Development: Implementation of a basic HTTP server capable of handling HTTP requests and responses.
Network Handling: Managing TCP connections, sockets, and data exchange over the network.
HTTP Protocol Compliance: Parsing various HTTP request types (e.g., GET, POST) and generating corresponding HTTP responses.
Server Configuration: Supporting server customization via configuration files or command-line parameters.
Error Handling and Logging: Implementation of error management and logging functionalities for server activities and requests.
Security Measures: Basic security measures implemented to address common vulnerabilities.
Testing and Documentation: Comprehensive testing to ensure server functionality and detailed documentation provided for usage and understanding.
## Purpose:

To deepen understanding of networking, HTTP protocols, and server-side programming concepts.
Providing practical experience in building a functional HTTP server from scratch.
Encouraging problem-solving and software design skills in a real-world server development scenario.
## Usage:

Clone the repository and compile the C++ source code using a compatible C++ compiler.
Configure the server using provided configuration files or command-line options.
Run the server and interact with it using HTTP client tools or browsers.
## Note:

This repository contains an educational project developed as part of the 42 Network's curriculum.
Contributions or enhancements aimed at improving server functionality, security, or additional features are welcomed.
